stddd = """To create a patch to resolve the issue, we need a strategy to modify the check_language_settings_consistent function such that it doesn't raise translation.E004 when a sublanguage is specified and a base language is available. This means we should modify the condition to not only check for an exact match with the LANGUAGE_CODE in the set of available tags but also to consider the case where a base language (e.g. 'de') should be acceptable if a sublanguage (e.g. 'de-at') is specified.

Here's the plan to generate the required patch:

1. Modify the check_language_settings_consistent function in django/core/checks/translation.py to include logic to parse the base language from a sublanguage in the LANGUAGE_CODE setting and check whether this base language is available in the LANGUAGES setting.
2. Create a patch file based on the changes we made.

Let's start by updating the function.

### Step 1: Modify the `check_language_settings_consistent` function

```python
@register(Tags.translation)
def check_language_settings_consistent(app_configs, **kwargs):
    # Error if language settings are not consistent with each other.
    language_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE.lower()
    available_tags = {tag.lower() for tag, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} | {'en-us'}

    # Check for an exact match or base language match for sublanguages (e.g. 'de' for 'de-at')
    if language_code not in available_tags:
        base_language = language_code.split('-')[0]
        if base_language not in available_tags:
            return [E004]
        
    return []
```

### Step 2: Create a patch file

Now that we have our updated function, I will create the patch as if I'd used the `git diff` command, but with the necessary logic simulated here.

Here's the resulting patch:

```

+        if base_language not in available_tags:
